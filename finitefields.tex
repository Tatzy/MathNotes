\section{Introduction}
I plan to keep some notes on finite fields here which are mostly inspired by interesting problems I see. Finite fields are one of my favorite algebraic structures and this document will be regularly updated to include problems and theorem I stumble across related to this topic.

\section{Polynomials over Finite Fields}
\begin{theorem} For any natural $d$ and field $F = GF(p^{k})$, there exists a polynomial $f \in F[X]$ which is irreducible over $F$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}Suppose $n = dk$ with $H = GF(p^{d})$. If we pick a generator for the multiplicative group of $F$ which we will call $\alpha$, then we can see $F = H(\alpha)$. $[F : H] = [H(\alpha) : H] = d$ which means the degree of the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ over $GF(p^{k})$ is $d$. Minimal polynomials are irreducible.

%Prove that F:K(a) = degree of minimal polynomial of a over K
\end{proof}

We technically used this fact so we should prove it here.
\begin{theorem}For a field $K$ with extension field $F = K(\alpha)$, $[F: K] = n$ if and only if the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ over $K$ is of degree $n$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof} $F$ as a $K$-vector space has a basis of order $n$. That is we can choose a basis $\beta = \{\beta_{0}, \beta_{2},...,\beta_{n-1}\}$. We have that for any $x$, that $\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\beta_{i}x^{i} \neq 0$ because of the linear independence of elements of $\beta$ which tells us that the degree of the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ is greater than or equal to $n$. Suppose now that there exists some $\beta_{n}$ such that $\sum_{i=0}^{n} \beta_{i}x^{i} \neq 0$ for any such $x$, then $F$ would have dimension $n+1$ so in fact a $\beta_{n}$ must exist such that $\alpha$ satisfies this polynomial.\\

For the reverse implication, we can see that if $f$ is the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ of degree $n$, then we can pick a basis generated by $\alpha$ for our vector space.
\end{proof}

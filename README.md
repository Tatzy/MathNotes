# MathNotes
Math notes from various projects, studies, and interests.

## Information
All of the files you will notice have a `.tex` extension. This of course implies that these notes are compiled in [Tex](https://www.tug.org/texlive/). Most files come equipped with some sort of `header.tex` file which should be included with the document (in the same folder) if you plan on compiling. As for the editor, I tend to switch back and forth and try different things but I am current using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Latex Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) extension. This allows me to have an actively updating pdf window in my editor as well as store my files locally.

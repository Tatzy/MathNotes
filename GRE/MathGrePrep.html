<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This document will serve as a review for the Mathematics Subject GRE. I am planning on taking the test in October of 2019, and I plan on reviewing (nearly) all of the topics on the GRE. My background is in pure mathematics, particularly I enjoy abstact algebra, mathematical logic, and computational complexity. However I have noticed that spending a lot of time away from things like calculus ultimately has slowed me down to unacceptable levels. What follows in the document will be completed exercises, commentary, and thoughts about the GRE. Hopefully someone may find this useful.<br />
To begin, ETS gives us a set of topics to review and their frequencies on the GRE. It makes sense to predetermine the order of which I go through these topics and decide which resources I would like to use for them. Note that this document is being updated as I go through this and certain review decisions may completely change.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Calculus - 50%</strong> In this section we will cover the basics of calculus up to Real Analysis. The plan is to cover <span class="citation" data-cites="Stewart">[@Stewart]</span> for calculus, <span class="citation" data-cites="Rudin">[@Rudin]</span> for analysis (the early chapters), and cover some calculus problems from the Princeton Review and <span class="citation" data-cites="UC">[@UC]</span> tests.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="trigonometric-functions">Trigonometric Functions</h2>
<p>In mathematics it sometimes helps us to derive results to better understand where they come from. This in turn anchors the facts in our memory. Unfortunately, trigonometric identities do not seem to behave in this way. However, I will derive them now anyways using the exponential function.</p>
<h3 id="some-identities">Some Identities</h3>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    e^{i\theta} &amp;= \cos(\theta) + i\sin(\theta)\\
    e^{i\theta}e^{i\tau} &amp;= (\cos(\theta) + i\sin(\theta))(\cos(\tau)+i\sin(\tau))\\
    e^{i(\theta+\tau)} &amp;= \cos(\theta)\cos(\tau)-\sin(\theta)\sin(\tau)+i(\sin(\theta)\cos(\tau) + \sin(\tau)\cos(\theta))\end{aligned}\]</span> Letting <span class="math inline">\(\theta = \tau\)</span> will provide us with some useful identities: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    e^{2i\theta} = \cos^{2}(\theta)-\sin^{2}(\theta)+i(2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta))\end{aligned}\]</span> Taking real and imaginary parts respectively, <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    \Re(e^{2i\theta}) &amp;= \cos(2\theta) = \cos^{2}(\theta) - \sin^{2}(\theta)\\
    \Im(e^{2i\theta}) &amp;= \sin(2\theta) = 2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)\end{aligned}\]</span> Knowing that <span class="math inline">\(-\sin^{2} = \cos^{2} - 1\)</span> we can now substitute into (5) to get <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    \cos(2\theta) = 2\cos^{2}(\theta) - 1 \quad \iff \quad \cos^{2}(\theta) = \frac{1 + \cos(2\theta)}{2}\\\end{aligned}\]</span> Similarly letting <span class="math inline">\(\cos^2 = 1 - \sin^2\)</span> we have <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    \cos(2\theta) = 1 - 2\sin^{2}(\theta) \quad \iff \quad \sin^{2}(\theta) = \frac{1-\cos(2\theta)}{2}\end{aligned}\]</span> We will find in calculus that is useful to have this ability to reduce the power of trigonometric functions, particularly as an integration technique. The formulas which we just derived are known as the <em>double angle formulas</em>. There are also <em>half angle formulas</em> by taking <span class="math inline">\(\theta = \frac{\tau}{2}\)</span> and taking a square root. Continuing on our identity frenzy it makes sense to talk about the which are closed form expressions in the case of <span class="math inline">\(e^{i (\theta \pm \tau)}\)</span>. We leave this as an exercise to derive, and they also somewhat rely on properties we will mention in the following section.</p>
<h3 id="extension-to-mathbbc">Extension to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{C}\)</span></h3>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    e^{iz} + e^{-iz}= \cos(z) + i\sin(z) + \cos(z) - i\sin(z) = 2\cos(z) \quad \iff \quad \frac{e^{iz}+e^{-iz}}{2} = \cos(z)\\
    e^{iz} - e^{-iz} = \cos(z) + i\sin(z) - \cos(z) + i\sin(z) = 2i\sin(z) \quad \iff \quad \frac{e^{iz}-e^{-iz}}{2i} = \sin(z)\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<h3 id="some-properties-of-trigonometric-functions">Some Properties of Trigonometric Functions</h3>
<p>We state the following identities without proof. <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    &amp;\cos(-x) = \cos(x)\\
    &amp;\sin(-x) = -\sin(x)\\
    &amp;\cos(x + 2\pi) = \cos(x)\\
    &amp;\sin(x + 2\pi) = \sin(x)\\
    &amp;\cos\left(x - \frac{\pi}{2}\right) = \sin(x)\\
    &amp;\sin\left( x + \frac{\pi}{2}\right) = \cos(x)\end{aligned}\]</span> And since we’ve been ignoring <span class="math inline">\(\tan\)</span> for some time <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    \tan(\theta + \tau) = \frac{\tan(\theta)+\tan(\tau)}{1-\tan(\theta)\tan(\tau)}\end{aligned}\]</span> We can see easily how negating <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> would yield another identity. In terms of power reduction we have the following formula <span class="math display">\[\tan(2\theta) = \frac{2\tan(\theta)}{1-\tan^{2}(\theta)}\]</span><br />
</p>
<h3 id="vietas-formulas">Vieta’s Formulas</h3>
<p>An extremely useful trick we have for finding roots of polynomials are <em>Vieta’s Formulas</em>. Say we have a polynomial <span class="math inline">\(a_n x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_{0}\)</span> with roots <span class="math inline">\(r_{1}, r_2, ..., r_n\)</span>. Then <span class="math display">\[a_{n}x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_0 = a_{n}(x-r_1)(x-r_2)\cdots(x-r_n)\]</span> It becomes clear from multiplying all of the constant terms that <span class="math inline">\(a_{n}\prod_{i=0}^{n}r_i = (-1)^{n}a_0\)</span> in other words <span class="math display">\[r_1 r_2 \cdots r_n = (-1)^{n}\frac{a_0}{a_n}\]</span> Similarly by counting coefficients (particularly of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>)<span class="math display">\[r_0 + r_1 + ... + r_n = (-1)^{n} \frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n}\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Example 1.</strong> Assuming all roots of <span class="math inline">\(x^3 - 3x^2 + 6x - 4\)</span> are of the form <span class="math inline">\(1+bi\)</span>, find the maximum value of <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span><br />
<em>Solution.</em> First we note that this polynomial is of degree 3, and it is not possible that it has all real roots. Thus the roots we are looking for are <span class="math inline">\(1+bi\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(1-bi\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>. By Vieta <span class="math display">\[1+bi + 1 -bi + r = 3 \rightarrow r = 1\]</span> <span class="math display">\[(1+bi)(1-bi) = 4 \rightarrow b = \sqrt{3}\]</span></p>
<h3 id="problems">Problems</h3>
<p><strong>1.</strong> If <span class="math inline">\(x \in \mathbb{R}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sin\sin(x) = \frac{1}{2}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(2 &lt; x &lt; 3\)</span>. Compute <span class="math inline">\(\cos(-\sin(x))\)</span>.<br />
<em>Solution.</em> The equation yields <span class="math inline">\(\sin(x) = \arcsin\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \Rightarrow \sin(x) = \frac{\pi}{6}\)</span> taking <span class="math inline">\(\cos\)</span> of both sides yields <span class="math inline">\(\cos(\sin(x)) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\)</span>.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Define <span class="math inline">\(\sinh(x) = \frac{e^{x}-e^{-x}}{2}\)</span>, what is a formula for <span class="math inline">\(\sinh^{-1}(x)\)</span>?<br />
<em>Solution.</em> Let <span class="math inline">\(y = \sin^{-1}(x)\)</span>, we wish to solve <span class="math inline">\(x = \frac{e^{y}-e^{-y}}{2}\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    2x &amp;= e^{y}-e^{-y}\\
    2xe^{y} &amp;= e^{2y} - 1 \Rightarrow 0 = e^{2y} - 2xe^{y} - 1 \quad let t = e^{y}\\
    0 &amp;= t^2 - 2xt - 1 \Rightarrow t = x \pm \sqrt{x^2 + 1}\\
    y &amp;= \log(x \pm \sqrt{x^2 + 1})\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> For which value <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2+3i\sin(\theta)}{1-2\sin(\theta)}\)</span> purely imaginary?<br />
<em>Solution.</em> Multiply the expression by the complex conjugate of the denominator to yield: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    \frac{2 - 6\sin^{2}(\theta)+7i\sin^{2}(\theta)}{1 + 4\sin^{2}(\theta)}\end{aligned}\]</span> It is clear that there is a lot of extraneous information in this expression, we need only that the real parts ‘cancel out’. <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    2 &amp;= 6\sin^{2}(\theta)\\
    \sqrt{\frac{1}{3}} &amp;= \sin(\theta) \Rightarrow \theta = \arcsin\left(\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}\right)\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>The problems seen here are not particularly interesting. The use of trigonometry is to reduce the complexity of problems in the future for the most part.</p>
